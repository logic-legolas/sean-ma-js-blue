    <center><h3>Week 1</h3></center><br>
    <p>   This week I made a program that asks you what your name is and where
      you are from, and then says "Hello (what your name is) from (where you are from)!"
      Also, for extra credit I made a Mad Lib that takes words you put in and makes them into a Mad Lib.</p>
